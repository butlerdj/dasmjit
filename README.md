Pascal port of AsmJit: complete x86/x64 JIT and Remote Assembler for C++

Ported by Nielsie95 with a couple of fixes from others, see https://villavu.com/forum/showthread.php?t=56493

  * [AsmJit Official Repository](https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit)
  * [Permissive ZLIB license](./LICENSE.md)

Note: as this is an older port of AsmJit, it doesn't support new instruction sets published after 2010 (like AVX)
